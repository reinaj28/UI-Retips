# UI-Retips
The goal of this project is to set up the user interface (UI) for a RAG framework
The fronted will be written in HTML and will include a quiery box, enter button, loading screen, and background
the output will print the catorgorized data at the bottom of the page (maybe add a section that prints how many were uploaded)

The backend will be in Javascript
No defined plans for this other than to support the frontend's buttons and workings
also needs to connect the frontend to the RAG framework

I will attach links to the bottom of this page to facilitate the project learning:
