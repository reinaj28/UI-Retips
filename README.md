# UI-Retips
The goal of this project is to set up the user interface (UI) for a RAG framework
python and will include a quiery box, enter button, loading screen, and background
the output will print the catorgorized data at the bottom of the page (maybe add a section that prints how many were uploaded)

The website we are using to follow this project uses Ollama software and streamlit libraries to directly connect a rag framework to their app. We are using the base template to update it to the connect to our framework and create desired look.

I will attach links to the bottom of this page to facilitate the project learning:
